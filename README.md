## Description

CallToChange is a Python-based Carbon Emission Calculator designed by Team LiquidDeath. This tool analyzes and calculates the carbon emissions generated by a company's LLM (Large Language Model) calls. The application offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and reducing the environmental impact of LLM call operations.

---

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for CallToChange stemmed from the growing need to address carbon emissions generated by technology operations. We aimed to create a tool that empowers companies to measure and mitigate their carbon footprint related to LLM calls.

---

## What it does

CallToChange seamlessly integrates with custom Python libraries to analyze and calculate LLM call emissions. It utilizes carbon conversion formulas to accurately determine the carbon footprint of each LLM call. Interactive dashboards with visualizations provide clear insights into emissions data, aiding companies in making informed decisions to reduce their environmental impact.

---

## How we built it

We developed CallToChange using Next.js for the frontend, seamlessly integrating it with custom Python libraries specialized in carbon emission calculations. The core of the application employs carbon emission calculation formulas that pull data from MongoDB to precisely quantify the carbon emissions associated with LLM calls. Additionally, we implemented interactive dashboards to empower users with actionable insights for informed decision-making.
