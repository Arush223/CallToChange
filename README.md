## Description

CallToChange is a carbon emission calculator designed by Team LiquidDeath. This tool analyzes and calculates the carbon emissions generated by a company's LLM (Large Language Model) calls. The application offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and reducing the environmental impact of LLM call operations.

---

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for CallToChange stemmed from the growing need to address carbon emissions generated by technology operations and a way to keep companies accountable and aware of the emissions they produce from AI usage. We aimed to create a tool that empowers companies to measure and mitigate their carbon footprint related to LLM calls.

---

## What it does

CallToChange seamlessly integrates with our custom Python library (call-to-change) to log LLM call emissions. It utilizes academic research and information from the Department of Energy to accurately determine the carbon footprint of each LLM call. Our visually engaging dashboards provide clear insights into emissions data, aiding companies in making informed decisions to reduce their environmental impact.

---

## How we built it

We developed CallToChange using Next.js and Python.

Our Python library logs LLM calls in MongoDB. Under the hood, our library does this by sending a POST request to API routes in our web app.

In our web app, we use Next.js and MongoDB to fetch user information (such as the number of times a user has used text generation). Using equations created based on academic research and Department of Energy factsheets, we calculate the emissions produced and the cost of offsetting these emissions. Additionally, we implemented visually appealing dashboards to empower users with actionable insights for informed decision-making.
